              Hello! My name is Abdur Rahaman Sultany and I enjoy creating
              things that live on the internet. My interest in web development
              started in 2021 when I decided to try to explore computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the of working at a start-up,
              a huge corporation. My main focus these days is building an
              accessible full-stack website.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need
              to build a web app.
